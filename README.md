## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
(no frameworks)

## Approach

I started by creating the basic HTML structure and then added the CSS to style the page using flexbox. I then wrote the basic arithmetic functions in JavaScript and added the event listeners to the buttons.

## Challenges

I had a few challenges with the JavaScript. I had to figure out how to get the numbers from the buttons and then how to get the operators. I also had to figure out how to get the numbers to display on the screen, and how to implement the AC and DEL buttons. But most of all, I had to figure out when to add or remove the the event listeners from the buttons so they would not interfere with each other, and how to get the decimal point to be included only once in each operand.

## Future features

- Add keyboard support
- Add more advanced functions(squareroot, power, etc.)
- Add a history of calculations
- Add a theme switcher
